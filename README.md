# APoD app (WIP)
APoD is an Android, iOS app which uses the Astronomy Picture of the Day API from NASA.
It shows the real-time daily picture from NASA and features image downloading and sharing in both OS, as well an explore section for visualize old astronomy daily pictures.
APoD is on permanent ampliation due to new features to add so it's not fully finished yet.

Any contributions are welcomed.
